# Gradual Verification Artifacts

## `proofs-svl-gvl`

Proofs for properties of a gradually verified language *GVL* based on a statically verified one *SVL*.

**The proofs were created using CoqIDE 8.6.**

## `docs-vmcai2018-suppmat`

Supplementary material for "Gradual Program Verification" (VMCAI 2018).

## `docs-svlidf-gvlidf`

Formalization of applying gradualization approach to an extension of *SVL* that uses implicit dynamic frames to safely reason about mutable state.
