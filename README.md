# Gradual Verification Artifacts

## `coq-svl-gvl`

Proofs for properties of a gradually verified language *GVL* based on a statically verified one *SVL*.

**The proofs were created using CoqIDE 8.6.**

## `pdf-svlidf-gvlidf`

Formalization of applying gradualization approach to an extension of *SVL* that uses implicit dynamic frames to safely reason about mutable state.
